# CELLS

An experiment with particles and Voronoi cells. Written with p5, uses [Dozed12's Voronoi library](https://github.com/Dozed12/p5.voronoi).

CELLS is a small experiment in creative coding. The screen is subdivided into "living cells" which moves around and eventually split into two new cells. Each newborn cell's hue is slightly different from its parent's. Clicking on a cell kills it.
